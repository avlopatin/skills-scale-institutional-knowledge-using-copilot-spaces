# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this README is the index and quick orientation for OctoAcme project management process documents. It summarizes the approach and links to the canonical process documents stored in this repo's docs/ folder.

## Quick summary — OctoAcme project management approach
OctoAcme uses a customer-focused, iterative approach that blends agile and lean practices to deliver predictable value with low risk.

- Iterative delivery: projects are broken into small, testable increments with regular demos and releases.
- Defined lifecycle stages: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead (PdM).
- Data-informed decisions: success is measured using predefined success metrics and dashboards.
- Frequent communication: daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and stakeholder updates.
- Proactive risk management: risks and cross-team dependencies tracked in a Risk Register and escalated via defined paths.
- Core artifacts: one-pagers, prioritized backlog, acceptance criteria, risk register, release notes, and retrospective action items.

Use the process docs below to apply consistent practices across projects and to onboard team members quickly.
