# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Include core team (PM, Product Manager, Dev Lead)
   - Invite specialized roles as needed: UX Designer, Business Analyst, DevOps Engineer, QA Lead
   - Ensure Stakeholder Representatives are present to voice business needs
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - Business Analyst facilitates requirements elicitation and documentation
   - UX Designer provides design constraints and user experience requirements
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Developers estimate implementation effort
   - QA Lead estimates testing effort
   - DevOps Engineer identifies infrastructure and deployment work
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - Include quality criteria (QA Lead)
   - Include design compliance (UX Designer)
   - Include deployment readiness (DevOps Engineer)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Technical dependencies (Developers, DevOps)
   - Business dependencies (Business Analyst, Stakeholder Representatives)
6. Create release plan and milestone map
